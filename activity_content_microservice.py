# Description:
#       Microservice for pulling json data from json file based on keyword.
#               - Currently takes one request at a time but can be modified to
#                 receive multiple requests.
#
#               - Currently overwrites contents in the response, but can be
#                 modified to append.
#
#               - Currently loops infinitely but can be modified to exit on
#                 command.
#
#               - On main program controller side, activity_request.txt should
#                 first be checked that the request has been received before
#                 sending new request, or previous request may be lost. Request
#                 is received when activity_request.txt is empty.
#                      - In other words, on the controller side, only write to
#                        an empty activity_request.txt file.

            parsed_json = json.load(pull)

        # Searches the JSON data for the requested keyword
        for entry in parsed_json:

            # finds the first entry in the dictionary pertaining to the keyword
            if entry["activity"].lower() == keyword.lower():
                # Write to activity_data.json -- overwrite mode
                with open(response_file, "a") as response:
                    # indentation for formatting (pretty printing)
                    json.dump(entry, response, indent=4)

                # Will only find the first entry -- Can be modified to return
                # multiple entries with the same keyword, if requested later.
                continue

    # No current request
